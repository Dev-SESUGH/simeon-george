REPO DONE FOR MICROVERSE TRIAL CHALLENGE

<!-- INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO DO THE JAVASCRIPT TRIALS -->

In this warm up, you and your coding partner will work together to solve two JavaScript coding challenges. One person will start as the Driver üöò and the other as the Navigator üß≠. Once you finish the first challenge, you will switch roles.

Decide who will start as Driver and who will be the Navigator.
The person that will start as the Driver should start a Zoom.us video call (if you aren't already on a call), invite the other person, and share their screen.
Then the current Driver will click here to get two challenges assigned\* (each one of you will solve one of the challenges).
‚ö†Ô∏è Remember, you must speak English during this entire session. We know it may be tempting to switch to your and your partner's native language, but this is one of the skills we are testing.

- Note: If you or your partner have already solved any of the assigned challenges, please refresh the spreadsheet to get two new challenges.
